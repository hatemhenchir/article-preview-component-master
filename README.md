# Article Preview Component with Fade-In Animation - React

This is my solution for the Article Preview Component challenge from Frontend Mentor with an added fade-in animation effect. The challenge was to create a responsive article preview component that displays an article image, title, author, and publishing date. Additionally, the component should have a share button that displays social media icons on click, and the social media icons should have a fade-in animation effect.
